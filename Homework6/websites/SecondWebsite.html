        <p>This is Rainy Forg!  He hails from the forest and loves just chillin' in the rain.  He even has a special rain hat just for the occasion!  Rainy Forg is always calm and satified.  Life is gonna keep rollin' and he's gonna keep rollin' with it.</p>

        <p>This is Flower Forg!  Approach slowly, he's a quite the shy guy.  While preferring to curl up in his flower with a true-crime podcast and chai tea to sip on, he's quite the sweetie once you get to know him!  This family is all about breaking set boundries and getting all comfy together!  Isn't that nice!  Flower Forg definitely thinks so.  He just won't say it in words due to his anxiety.  Right Flower Forg?    "..."    He definitely agrees!</p>
        <h3>Besties Forg</h3>

        <p>Say hello to Besties Forg!  He parties with everybody and everybody loves him!  He's best besties with Tarantula.  He babysits her eggs while she goes out and she's got his back at the more devious parties.  These two are practically inseperable, a package deal.  Besties Forgy will be a great friend to you here!  He definitely won't snitch you out the second he gets, that's just cruel gossip.  Also, if Tarantula hears you say that, she'll tangle you up in a web of trouble so bad you'll never get out unscathed!</p>
        <h3>Crisis Forg</h3>

        <p>Crisis Forg has recently discovered the secrets of the universe with us!  His face has looked like that ever since he found out five days ago.  His face will relax eventually, we think.  He screamed the first day, but has since run out of voice.  Now it's just a stream of wheezy air that hisses out.  He's our own white noise machine!  He'll be fine.  We'll take good care of him.</p>
